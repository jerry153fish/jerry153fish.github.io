I am Jerry Chen. I am a lifelong programmer firstly as hardware programmer for 6 years now as a full stack programmer for three years. I live in Tasmania the most beautiful island in the world.

Since my first c 'Hello World' in hight school, I have use C/C++/Assemble, Python, JS, Java/C#, SQL. I like hacking things for fun in my workshop including apps, electronic devices, knifes, wood / store handcrafts, paintings, toys and so on.
